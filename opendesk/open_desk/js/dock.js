// The dock: apps down the left of the desk, where Frappe's Dock lists the open app's
// modules.
//
// Built on the Dock rather than beside it. Frappe 16.50 draws a column left of the sidebar (the
// Dock) holding the modules of whichever app owns the sidebar on screen, and a header menu over
// the sidebar. This keeps the column and everything Frappe does with it -- pinned or floating,
// hidden where a page hides it, the user menu at its foot -- and changes only what is in it:
//
//   - the column lists the apps `opendesk.open_desk.desk_apps` resolves (the
//     Desk Apps, then every installed app for the modules those leave unclaimed), the one
//     you are in lit, and its mark at the top is the site's, leading to the Apps screen;
//   - picking an app offers its modules, in one of seven ways Open Desk Settings' "Module
//     Picker" chooses between (below). Its tooltip is just its name;
//   - the header menu over the sidebar lists the open app's modules, under the Categories and
//     Spacers its Desk App sets, in place of Frappe's switcher rows;
//   - the header names the app as well as the module, since the dock's lit tile is an app and
//     Frappe's header names only the module;
//   - Search and Notifications sit at the foot of the dock, over the user's avatar, rather than
//     at the top of the sidebar. They are Frappe's own: the dock's buttons carry the classes
//     Frappe opens search from (`navbar-modal-search-mobile`, a delegated click) and puts the
//     unread count into (`notification-count`, every one on the page), and the bell toggles
//     Frappe's notifications panel. Other apps' tiles follow them (`opendesk.dock.tools`, below):
//     Commons' To Do, say, opening its own panel the same way. Frappe's panels open beside the
//     dock, over the sidebar, rather than beside the sidebar;
//   - the user menu's Manage Dock, which arranges a Dock nothing draws while the dock is on, gives
//     way to Manage Desk Apps, and a click on the module list's header opens Manage Modules for that
//     app (both `js/arrange.js`). They arrange what the dock does draw, and it is redrawn in
//     place when they save (`opendesk.dock.apply`).
//
// The module picker, "Module Menu" (the default), "App Menu", "Sliding Sidebar", "Module Tabs",
// "Three Column", "Accordion Dock" or "Accordion Sidebar" (`features.module_picker`), says where
// an app's modules are offered. What picking an app on the dock does is a setting of its own, the
// same in every picker (`features.app_pick`, "Picking an App"):
//
//   - Show Its Modules (the default): picking an app offers its modules, over the page you are
//     on, until one is picked -- as each picker describes below.
//   - Open Last Module: picking another app goes into it, to the module last open in it in this
//     browser, else its first, and the picker offers the rest from there. Picking the app you are
//     in offers its modules, as above.
//   - Open Last Sidebar Item: the same, to the sidebar item last open in the app -- the page of
//     the row Frappe lit -- rather than the module's landing page; the module last open in it
//     where there is no such item.
//
// App Menu. Frappe's own dock, nearly: the open app's mark at the top and its modules under it,
// a tile each, named in a tooltip, the sidebar holding the open module's content. The mark opens a menu of the apps -- in place of the Apps screen, which the
// menu's last row leads to. With Show Its Modules, an app picked from the menu takes the dock,
// mark and modules, over the page you are on, until a module is picked or it is put back as
// the band's is. On a phone too, the dock being in the sidebar's drawer ("Show Dock on Mobile");
// without it, the header menu offers the modules there.
//
// Sliding Sidebar. The sidebar's rows become the app's modules -- its frontend first, set apart,
// then the modules under their Categories and Spacers -- and its header is the app: its mark,
// its name, and how many modules it has. Nothing
// else moves: the page stays where it was until a module is picked, and navigating anywhere
// else puts back the sidebar for wherever you land. Frappe's own state is left alone, so
// leaving the list is only rebuilding the sidebar Frappe already thinks it is showing. An app
// with one module, or only a frontend, has no choice to show and opens it.
//
// The rows move to say which way you went: a module opened from the list comes in from the right
// (one level down), the list comes in from the left (one level up), and switching app or module
// sideways -- from the header menu, or an app of one module -- fades. Above a module's content,
// a row naming its app goes back up to the list. The header's menu, which would only list the
// modules again, is gone wherever nothing else is left in it, and Edit Sidebar is a pencil in the
// sidebar's lower right corner. Only what a person clicked here animates; the
// rebuilds Frappe makes on its own as you navigate just appear, or motion would stop meaning
// anything.
//
// Module Menu. Each level of the hierarchy has one surface: the dock holds apps, the sidebar's
// header holds the module -- the app over the module open in it, and a menu to change it -- and
// the sidebar's rows are always the module's content. The modules are never sidebar rows: they
// are the header's menu, the one on screen marked, ending in Manage Modules. Picking an app on
// the dock opens that menu on the app's modules, the header naming the app over "Choose a
// module" until it closes, over the sidebar of the page you are on, which stays as it is until
// a module is picked.
//
// Three Column. The three levels are three columns: the dock, then a column of the app's modules,
// then the sidebar, which only ever holds the module's content and is headed by the module alone,
// the column naming the app. Three columns are a lot of the screen, so each can give room back:
// the module column folds to its icons (its foot's button, remembered in this browser), and folded
// it opens over the sidebar while the pointer is on it, or when an app is picked on the dock; the
// sidebar folds as Frappe folds it. Picking another app on the dock shows its modules in the
// column, over the page you are on, until a module is picked or the page changes. Below 768px,
// where the dock and the sidebar are a drawer with no room for a third column, there is no column,
// and the header menu picks, as the Module Menu does.
//
// Module Tabs. Each level runs its own way: apps down the dock, the app's modules across a band at
// the top -- over the sidebar and the page alike, the app's mark and name first -- and the
// module's content down the sidebar. The band costs height rather than width, so the page loses no
// columns to it. Tabs that do not fit go under More, which takes the open module's name when that
// is one of them. Picking another app on the dock shows its modules in the band, none of them lit,
// until a module is picked, the page changes, or Escape or a click elsewhere puts it back. Below
// 768px there is no band, and the header menu offers the modules, as the Module Menu does. Beside
// the band the sidebar has no header, and Edit Sidebar is a pencil in its lower right corner, as
// in the Sliding Sidebar.
//
// Accordion Dock. The open app's tile opens up on the dock to show its modules under it, a tile
// each, named in a tooltip; the sidebar holds the open module's content. Moving into another app,
// its modules slide open under it as the last app's slide shut; picking another app on the dock
// opens its tray in the open app's place, the same way, until a module is picked or it is put back
// as the band's is. A click on the open app's own tile folds its tray away and back. On a phone
// too, the dock being in the sidebar's drawer ("Show Dock on Mobile"); without it, the header menu
// offers the modules there.
//
// Accordion Sidebar. The sidebar lists the open app's modules as headings, the open module's
// content under its own heading. A heading of another module opens it
// (its content sliding open as the last module's slides shut); the open module's heading folds
// its content away and back. Picking another app on the dock shows its modules' headings, every
// one closed, until one is picked or they are put back as the band's are. At every width: on a
// phone the sidebar is a drawer.
//
// In all of them but Three Column beside its column, the sidebar's header names the app over the
// module open in it, as the levels run, with the app's mark -- words alone with App Menu, whose
// dock carries the mark (`refresh_header`). And an app with one module, or only a frontend, has no choice to show and opens it.
//
// Which app a module is in is written into the boot by `js/boot_arrangement.js`: each module's
// dock app into `module_sidebars[shell].app`, and an `app_data` entry for each dock app Frappe
// does not know, so Frappe's own header names the right app and logo -- again whenever Frappe
// replaces either.
//
// Off unless Open Desk Settings' "Override Dock" is ticked, and off too if Frappe has moved
// what this hangs on: then the desk is simply Frappe's. Every change to Frappe's classes goes
// through `patch`, so if Frappe changes something this reads and a change throws, the dock
// switches itself off for the rest of the page and Frappe's own method runs instead (`give_up`).
// `test_frappe_seams.py` checks every name this hangs on is still in Frappe's source.
//
// Tiles of other apps' own, at the dock's foot after Search and Notifications. An app adds one by
// pushing a description onto `opendesk.dock.tools`, which it makes itself if it loads first:
//
//   frappe.provide("opendesk.dock");
//   (opendesk.dock.tools = opendesk.dock.tools || []).push({
//       name: "todos",                 // unique among the tiles
//       label: __("To Do"),            // the tooltip and the accessible name
//       icon: "list-todo",             // one of the desk's icons
//       class: "my-panel-trigger",     // optional: classes on the button
//       badge_class: "my-badge",       // optional: a count badge on the tile's corner, drawn hidden
//       condition: () => true,         // optional: whether this user gets the tile
//       on_click: ($button) => {},
//       on_draw: ($button) => {},      // optional: once the tile is on the page
//   });
//
// A plain array, read when the dock draws its foot, so it does not matter which app's script
// loads first, and an app that adds a tile needs nothing from this one when the dock is off or
// this app is not installed. A tile that throws is left out.
